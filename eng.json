  "about_terminal_text": "When creating Indigo payment terminals, we did not intend to just reinvent iron boxes with an existing set of functions. But we have created a product that will allow us not only to perform the usual actions, such as paying for various services, adding funds to your phone or Bank card account.\nThe Indigo payment terminal is a part of the city infrastructure, where every resident or guest of the city can get useful information or use a much more non-standard service for such a device. For example, you can call a taxi to the specified address, or choose and book a room in a hotel you like. And much more.\nIt is not for nothing that it is noted that the already familiar solutions outwardly are only iron boxes. Creating the Indigo terminal as part of the urban environment of the future, our engineers and technical designers have put a lot of effort into making it not only pleasant to use, but also easy to watch as you walk past it on the street",
